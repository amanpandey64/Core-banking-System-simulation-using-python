# Core-banking-System-simulation-using-python
Overview : The Basic ATM Simulator is a Python project that replicates core ATM functionalities in an interactive and user-friendly system. It demonstrates key programming concepts such as loops, conditional statements, input validation, and error handling while mimicking real-world banking operations.
Features : 
a) Check Balance: Displays the current account balance.
b) Deposit Money: Validates and updates the account balance.
c) Withdraw Money: Ensures sufficient funds before processing withdrawals.
d) Exit: Allows users to gracefully exit the program.
The program ensures logical input validation and prevents crashes with robust error handling.
Techniques and Concepts :
a) Loops: Continuous interaction until the user exits.
b) Conditional Statements: To validate user choices and process transactions.
c) Input Validation: Ensures amounts are positive and sufficient for withdrawals.
d) Error Handling: Uses try-except blocks for invalid input management.
Key Highlights : This project is designed to:-
a) Simulate real-world ATM operations using Python basics.
b) Provide a seamless user experience with error handling.
c) Translate practical scenarios into Python code.
What I Learned :
a) Creating an interactive and logical system.
b) Validating and safeguarding user inputs for accuracy.
c) Implementing error handling for a crash-free experience.
d) Enhancing problem-solving and coding efficiency in Python.
